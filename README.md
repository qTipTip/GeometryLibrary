# GeometryLibrary
A small Python(3) library for computing and visualizing geometric structures.
The library was written during a course on geometric modelling, and currently supports
mainly BÃ©zier related objects.

The library offers the possibility of plotting and composing curves and surfaces in a
fairly small number of lines of code.
